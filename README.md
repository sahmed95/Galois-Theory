# Galois-Theory and Solvability of Polynomials 

A polynomial, f, is solvable if the solution of the equation f(x) = 0 is possible using arithmetic operations and taking square roots, cube roots, etc. Given that not all polynomials are solvable, the aim of the project is to determine whether a given polynomial is solvable. This project uses Galois theory and implements Galois' algorithm to determine the answer. The algorithm is implemented in Sage.
