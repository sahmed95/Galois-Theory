# Galois-Theory and Solvability of Polynomials 

A polynomial,f, is solvable if the solution of the equation f(x) = 0 is possible using arithmetic operations and taking square roots, cube roots, etc. However, not all polynomials are solvable. This project uses Galois theory and implements Galois' algorithm to compute whether a given polynomial is solvable.
